Image Layers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    1. Each instruction in a Dockerfile roughly translates to an image layer.
    2. Each Instructions in the dockerfile is cached.
    3. When you run a build, the builder attempts to reuse layers from earlier builds
    4. When no changes is done and the image is rebuild --> build it from the chached image Layers
    5. If change occurs in particular layer.. the subsequent bellow layers are re-run
