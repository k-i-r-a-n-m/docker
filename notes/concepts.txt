Image Layers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    1. Each instruction in a Dockerfile roughly translates to an image layer.
    2. Each Instructions in the dockerfile is cached.
    3. When you run a build, the builder attempts to reuse layers from earlier builds
    4. When no changes is done and the image is rebuild --> build it from the chached image Layers
    5. If change occurs in particular layer.. the subsequent bellow layers are re-run

Docker Volumes  - Anonymous vs named
VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV

    ANONYMOUS:

        1. VOLUME [path] - in dockerfile creates anonymous volumes
        2. They are deleted when the container is run with --rm flag
        3. every when a container is run newly it create new anonymous volumes(not useful)
    
    NAMED:

        1. -v <volume_name:path_inside_container> is usefull to create Named Volumes
        2. These are not deleted when the container is removed even with --rm
