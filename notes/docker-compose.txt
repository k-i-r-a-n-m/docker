                    CONCEPT
==================================================

One config file 
        + 
orchestration commands (builds,start,stop)...


what docker-compose is NOT:
-----------------------------
1. managing multi-contianer in diffrent host(machines)
2. doesn't replaces the image or container
3. doesn't replaces DOCKERFILE for custom images




((((((((((((HOW to use:))))))))))))

--> docker-compose.yaml / compose.yaml

1. docker-compose up
    ''' default runs in attached mode '''

    --> -d = run in detached mode
    --> --build = force the build step instead of using existing build images

2. docker-compose down 
     ''' Removes 
            -default network
            -container being created
            -but doesn't removes the volume
     '''

    --> -v - removes the volume

3. docker-compose build 
    - just build the custom dockerfiles without triggering run containers




XXXXXXXXXX
   NOTE
XXXXXXXXXX
1. No need to create Network for the services involved. (Created by docker-compose by default)
2. Service names can be used inside the code even though docker-compose creates a different container names 
   --> (service:mongodb) 
   --> ie. "mongodb://mongodb:27017/course-goals"

3. docker-compose won't rebuild unless any changes occurs in the docker file . ("build" instruction in docker-compose under service)
