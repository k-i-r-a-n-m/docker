DockerFile Instructions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1.RUN - cmd's to run when building the image

2.CMD - cmd's to run when the container is being run

3.EXPOSE - <port/protocol(TCP)>  **Optional

    The EXPOSE instruction doesn't actually publish the port.
    It functions as a type of "documentation" between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container, 
    about which ports are intended to be published.

    eg. 
        --> EXPOSE 80/udp
        --> docker run -p 80:80/tcp -p 80:80/udp ...

4. VOLUME - "path1 path2 ...n"/[paths...n] 

    Creates Anonymous volumes when the container is run
    eg.
        --> VOLUME ["/app/feedback"]

5. ENV <variable_name> <value>
6. ARG <variable_name> <value>

    Note: -don't use at global level since, it's a layer affects bellow layers.
          -Keep it close to where the variable is being used.

    eg.
        --> ARG DEFAULT_PORT=3000
        --> ENV PORT $DEFAULT_PORT
        --> EXPOSE $PORT
